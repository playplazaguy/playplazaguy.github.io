        <h3>We all know about technology. You are literally using it to read this page! But, have you ever thought how it will look like in the future?
            I mean, in the 60s, IBM would have never even dreamed of selling a personal computer, but look at the world now! I always stop to think about what the future could be for tech.
            <br>
            <br>
            First up: Quantum Computers.
            <br>
            You may know what a CPU is. Millions of transitiors stopping or starting the flow of elctrons, like 1s and 0s. 
            But, we are getting so small that the transitiors won't even be able to stop the flow of electrons!
            So, people are starting to create Quantum Computers. It's more efficent, and it't not even just 1s and 0s anymore!
            This is literally changing the face of computing since room-sized computers in the 60s.
            What do I think? This is revolutanary and could put a dent in the computing universe.
            <br>
            <br>
            Second: The Transition from Hardware to Cloud Files.
            <br>
            The Cloud is a type of file storage like Dropbox, AWS, and even web hosting! But, people are now starting to transitioning
            from hardware storage to cloud storage. Now, I see a good and bad side to this.
            <br>
            Good - You don't take up as much space on your computer. This is good for most end-users. 
            <br>
            Bad - The internet is prone to failure and harder to access your files. This isn't so good for the IT person.
            <br>
            So there are ups and downs, but we can all use what we want for now.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Alright, I will be making blog posts in more detail about these in the future, but it is currently 2 in the morning as I write this,
            so I'm going to bed. I will try to get a new post next week. Thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!
